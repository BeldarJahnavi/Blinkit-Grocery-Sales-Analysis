📊 Blinkit Sales Analysis — End-to-End Excel Data Analytics Project
🧾 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete Data Analytics workflow using Microsoft Excel, based on real-time Blinkit sales data.
The objective is to analyze Blinkit’s sales performance, identify key insights, and build an interactive Excel dashboard for data-driven decision-making.

Through this project, you’ll learn how to handle the entire analytics lifecycle — from requirement gathering to dashboard creation — using only Excel.

🎯 Project Objectives

Understand client and business requirements.

Clean and preprocess raw sales data.

Perform analytical computations using Excel formulas and Pivot Tables.

Visualize important KPIs with dynamic charts.

Create an interactive dashboard to summarize insights for stakeholders.

🧩 Steps Covered
1️⃣ Requirement Gathering

Understand the client’s objective: Analyze Blinkit’s sales, customer trends, and product performance.

Define the Key Questions:

What are the total sales and average sales per outlet?

Which item types and outlet types perform best?

How do outlet sizes and locations affect sales?

What are the top-performing categories?

3️⃣ Data Cleaning

Performed in Excel using:

Removal of duplicates and blanks

Handling missing or incorrect entries (e.g., Outlet Size or Item Weight)

Standardizing text data (using TRIM(), PROPER(), etc.)

Ensuring numeric columns are correctly formatted for analysis

4️⃣ Data Processing

Created new calculated columns such as:

Total Sales = Item_Outlet_Sales

Discounted Price = Item_MRP * (1 - Discount%)

Profit Margin = (Selling Price - Cost Price) / Cost Price

Added categorical groupings for easier segmentation.

Excel Functions Used:
IF(), VLOOKUP(), INDEX-MATCH, TEXT(), CONCATENATE(), ROUND(), etc.

5️⃣ Data Analysis

Utilized Pivot Tables for:

Total Sales by Outlet Type

Sales by Item Type and Location

Average Sales per Outlet Size

Yearly and Monthly performance trends

6️⃣ Data Visualization

Created multiple visualizations using:

Column & Bar Charts for category-wise comparison

Pie Charts for sales contribution

Line Charts for time-based trends

Slicers & Filters for interactivity

Each chart is formatted with clean colors, legends, and proper labeling.
